# Functions, Objects, and Arrays

For this assignment, your task is to fill out the functions in the files found in the src directory. There are 3 files:

* arrayFunctions.js
* functions.js
* objectFunctions.js

You will find instructions in each file.

2 of the 3 files have tests written for them.

To get the tests working you will need to do a `npm install` and then you can do an `npm test` to run the tests one shot, or you can run `npm run watchTest` to have the test runner watch the files and re run the tests on a file change (save).

Lastly, when you run the tests, the test runner will generate a test-report.html file in the root of the directory you can live serve this file for a pretty output if that helps you.
