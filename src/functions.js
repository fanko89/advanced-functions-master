//there are no tests for this file.

//demonstrate 3 ways to declare a function

//write a function that only applies a side-effect (no return value)

//write a function that returns a value

//write a function that accepts a function as a parmeter and runs it after 2 seconds (callback function)

//write a function that returns a promise, and after 2 seconds resloves with a value of "Hello there"

//write a function that returns a new function. The new function should return/create a new function that multiplies a number pased to the new function
// by a static number that was passed to the orginal function.
// id if I called the main function with a parameter of 2, it would return a new function that would multiply any number passed to the new function by 2

//lastly call the functions here. Be sure to log to the console values. To grade this, the first thing I will be doing is running `node functions.js`
//I will be looking to see if you accomplished the above tasks. Error on the side of more logging to the console. And of course I will be looking at your code.
//well documented code is always helpful.
//5 points extra credit if you format the console.log messages.
